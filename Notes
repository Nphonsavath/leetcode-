217. Contains Duplicate: Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
  IDEA: Add to hashmap/hashset to keep track of if it appeared and check

242. Valid Anagram: An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
  IDEA: Can use hashmap to keep track of all the letters that appear, or use array and increment index of ascii value and decrement index of ascii to ensure it is at 0 or not

1. Two Sum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
  IDEA: Clever trick to use hashmap to check if map contains (target number - the value at index i in for loop), if it does return both otherwise add to map

49. Group Anagrams: Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
  IDEA: iterate through each string in String[], create a char[] to store each letter and iterate through each character in string as an array, ascii subtraction increment, get the string of that array and if its not a keyyet add it with its value as an arrayList and add get that key and add string, return arrayList with map.values()

20. Valid Parentheses: Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
  IDEA: iterate through string, if open push, if not check if stack empty (that means no matching), peek at top, if the top is an open bracket and the char is a closed bracket they match and pop, if not return false. return stack.isEmpty()
