Linear
  Arrays
  Linked List
  Strings

  Two Pointers
    Same Direction
      Fast/Slow pointer for cycles or middle of list
    Opposite Direction
      Finding pairs, comparing elements on each end

  Sliding Window extension of Two Pointers
  
  Binary Search O(log n)
    Search algo for finding in sorted array, by dividing in half
    Can be used on anything monotonic 


Non-Linear
  Trees (just a graph with no cycles)
  Graphs (tree with cyles, need a visited set())

  Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    Explore level by level
    Uses queue (FIFO)
    Best for shortest path

  Depth-First Search (DFS)
    Dive deeper first
    Uses stack (recursion)
    Best for exploring all paths

  Backtracking, extension of DFS
    Need to built itself, unlike prebuilt structure for DFS
