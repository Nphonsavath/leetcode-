Heap (default min heap in python)
  heap = []
  heapq.heappush(heap, item)
    Push the value item onto the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.

  heapq.heappop(heap)
  Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap invariant. If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised. To access the smallest item without popping it, use heap[0].

  len(heap)

Set
  seen = set()
  set.add(item)
    The add() method adds a given element to a set. If the element is already present, it doesn't add any element.

isalnum()
  The method str.isalnum() checks if the character (or string) consists only of alphanumeric characters â€” i.e., letters (a-z, A-Z) and digits (0-9).
    Time Complexity: O(1) for single char
                     O(n) for string
    Space Complexity: O(1)

lower()
  The lower() method returns a string where all characters are lower case.  Symbols and Numbers are ignored.
    Time Complexity: O(n) for iterating through entire string
    Space Complexity: O(n) for new string created
