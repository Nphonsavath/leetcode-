Heap (default min heap in python)
  heap = []
  heapq.heappush(heap, item)
    Push the value item onto the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.

  heapq.heappop(heap)
  Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap invariant. If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised. To access the smallest item without popping it, use heap[0].
